that the world had changed around him. He frowned as he saw the trees, oddly shaped to his eyes, smelt the new air, tainted
with alchemical fumes, and looked upon the gravel beneath his feet, now less of a worn route through a forest than a laid
path, cared for and maintained" VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="663"/>

hand on the hilt of his lone sword as he did so. " VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="663"/>
